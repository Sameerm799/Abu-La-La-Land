# Abu-La-La-Land
Pull the .exe file to play the game. 
This is a 2D rogue-like platformer. Where you play Abu the goat who has to traverse the desert realms and collect his favorite fruit: pineapples. Abu's enemy are the mini crocs who will do anything to stop him from making it out. The terrain is also one of Abu's enemies. 

This is a rogue-like game, instead of the player completely starting over, in this game the player will start one level back.

This game was a school project that I had a week and a half to complete. Its the first game I've ever developed. The game was developed in Unity using C# scripts.

Theres animations I want to add and make the game even more fluid.

The yellow dot is the cast-point of the detection system. If the player is in the range of the enemy within the cast-point, the enemy will change state to attack.
